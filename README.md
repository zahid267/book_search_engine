# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine - book_search_engine


This application is a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app is built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. 

To complete the assignment, the following have been done:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.

2. Setup the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) walkthrough for instructions.
